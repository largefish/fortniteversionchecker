# fortniteversionchecker
This is a simple Python script that can be used to track the current version of Fortnite and send an email whenever there is a game update.
This is useful because some platforms *cough*Playstation*cough* don't automatically install game updates unless you subscribe to their monthly service.
You can use cron to run the script daily (or however frequently you wish) so you will be notified whenever there is an update.

The hardest part of writing this script was finding the proper Fortnite API endpoint to check the version numbers. Here's to hoping Epic Games doesn't change it.
